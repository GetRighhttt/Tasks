# Tasks-RoomDatabase-Coroutines-LiveData-MVVM-NavigationComponent-

### Description :

<p>This application was built as a demonstration of how to incorporate ROOM Database<br>
into your application. It saves tasks into a recycler view. The user is able to edit<br>
the tasks, update, save, or delete it, and the tasks then gets added back to the list.<br>
I also added in recycler view animations just for a little fun. A copy of the list is <br>
stored in ROOM database, and should remain available after the app is closed.</p>
